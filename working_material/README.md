# Content discussion

Hi all, if you read this, it probably means you are thinking about joining the team who will build this module. While it is called open research data, the topic can range the whole research data management field. We want to give it a practical flair and not talk too much about policies, legal problems and other administrative aspects. In the contrary, I would like this module to present very basic data literacy problems and how these are relevant to produce open FAIR data.

Inside my job in Jena, I produced a list of rdm training sub-topics you can find in this folder, you might also look at this document if you want to know more about RDM training: https://www.overleaf.com/read/dqybrmmsbpnc. The first job for the team will be to choose what topics we want to present inside the OSMOOC, I think 3 to 4 of them is the maximum we can ask from the participants.

I personally think we should try to focus on the RDM skills allowing a reproducible analysis (module 3), and the publication of the data. But I hope to start the discussion soon !
