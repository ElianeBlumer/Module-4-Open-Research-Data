all links working? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-4-Open-Research-Data.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-4-Open-Research-Data)

## Rationale <a name="Rationale"></a>

Open research data refers to the publishing the data underpinning scientific research results so that they have no restrictions on their access. Openly sharing data opens it up to inspection and re-use, forms the basis for research verification and reproducibility, and opens up a path to broader collaboration. In this module, you will gain insight into the importance of data sharing for reproducible research and how to curate and share your own research data.


## Learning outcomes <a name="Learning outcomes"></a>

At the end of this module, the participant will be able to:

    1.Understand the benefits of embracing open data practices
    2.Recognize the importance of data documentation (metadata), by getting familiarized with the FAIR principles and the research data management concepts.
    3.Identify data format issues and their relation to data archiving and analysis.
 4.Publish data in a data repository relevant to his scientific discipline or community

## Github workflow

Dear development team, since the master branch is used for production, we will use this "development" branch as our main development site. It means that here are the latest stable changes to be found.

Please do not commit on this branch directly, but create a new branch and make changes on that branch. Then create a pull request from your new branch to this branch "development". This will make sure that:

1. The development history will be easier to follow.
2. The workflow will be easier if there are conflicting changes, done by different team members.
3. We will be able to review every change as a team.
