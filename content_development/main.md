## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>



### Who is this module for? <a name="who_for"></a>

Designed primarily for students and researchers at the graduate and undergraduate level, this module also serves as training material for postdocs and more senior researchers. We want to help make openness universal and for all, not just a select few. This aims to be a cross-disciplinary module covering all research branches, including Engineering, Medicine, Biosciences, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Humanities, and the Arts.

We have set a highly inclusive standard, and right from the very beginning have had people from across the *whole* spectrum of scholarly research, and related disciplines like tech, publishing, and librarianship, involved in developing and scoping the project. We use the term 'Open Science' given that this seems to be the phrase that global changes are coalescing around; while recognising that terms such as 'Open Research' or 'Open Scholarship', although less widely used, might capture a bit better what our intention is here.

Therefore, irrespective of your background **you are very much welcome here**.

### Specific learning objectives for this module <a name="objectives"></a>

1. Experience the hassle of accessing research data which is not open, and understand the benfits of open data.

2. Understand the importance of data documentation (metadata), and get familiarised with the FAIR principles and research data management concept

3. Understand data format issues and its relation to  data archiving and analysis.


4. Choose a repository and publish FAIR open data.

## Where to go from here <a name="future"></a>

Hopefully now you have come to see the importance of Open data as a fundamental part of modern research. 


The **learning outcomes** from this for you should be:

* You will now plan your data workflow in order to be able to publish FAIR (open) data.

* You will know where to look for more information about data mangement and publication.

* You will know how to cite data

* You should be eager to learn better way to analyse your data in the module 3 of this mooc!
