## Overview of the course <a name="abstract"></a>

With this course, we want to propose a practical approach to open data. Participants should be experiencing the benefits of open data for their own research question and be able to tackle the problem of data documentation early in their workflow. Ideally, after this course, each participant should be eager to learn more about data management and know where to find additional information.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>



### Who is this module for? <a name="who_for"></a>

Designed primarily for students and researchers at the graduate and undergraduate level, this module also serves as training material for postdocs and more senior researchers. We produced this module with the objective to talk as much to SSH and STM communities, Whatever the type of data produced or collected. 

If you are reading this, it probably means this lectures was created for you, and you are very welcome here.

### Specific learning objectives for this module <a name="objectives"></a>

At the end of this module, the participant will be able to:

    1.Understand the benefits of embracing open data practices
    2.Recognize the importance of data documentation (metadata), by getting familiarized with the FAIR principles and the research data management concepts.
    3.Identify data format issues and their relation to data archiving and analysis.
 4.Publish data in a data repository relevant to his scientific discipline or community 
 
<br/>



## Where to go from here <a name="future"></a>

Hopefully now you have come to see the importance of Open data as a fundamental part of modern research. 


The **learning outcomes** from this for you should be:

* You will now plan your data workflow in order to be able to publish FAIR (open) data.

* You will know where to look for more information about data mangement and publication.

* You will know how to cite data

* You should be eager to learn better way to analyse your data in the module 3 of this mooc!
